                <h2>Reflection on "Twelve Pillars"</h2>
                <p>
                    In Chapters 4-7 of <i>Twelve Pillars</i> by Jim Rohn and Chris Widener, the authors explore the importance of relationships, leadership, and personal growth, particularly through mentorship. One key lesson is the value of surrounding ourselves with people who challenge us to grow. This applies to both personal and professional environments. Additionally, the principle of lifelong learning is emphasized, which is crucial in adapting to a world of constant change.

                <p>
                    As someone working towards a <strong>degree in Computer Science</strong>, I found these lessons incredibly relevant. Building strong networks and being open to continuous learning are essential for my personal and professional growth. I plan to apply these teachings by seeking mentorship, fostering positive relationships, and developing my leadership qualities.
