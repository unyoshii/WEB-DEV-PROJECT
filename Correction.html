            <p>Hello! My name is Oshane Smith. I was born on November 6th, 2002, at May Pen Hospital in Clarendon, Jamaica. I attend the University of Technology, Jamaica, where I am currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science. I'm a typical Gen Z adult: I enjoy watching anime, playing video games, listening to music, and I really appreciate spending time by myself. During my teenage years, I played a variety of sports, including U-14, U-15, and Dacosta Cup Football, as well as 400m track and field. I also participated in a Netball competition. My current goal is to graduate with my bachelor's degree and become a software engineer.</p>
